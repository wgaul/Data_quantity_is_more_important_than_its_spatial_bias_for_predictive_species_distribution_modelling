# Data_quantity_is_more_important_than_its_spatial_bias_for_predictive_species_distribution_modelling
This repository contains code for the paper "Data quantity is more important than its spatial bias for predictive species distribution modelling".

The simulations and analyses can be run by sourcing 'main_large_community_simulation.R' to run the large community simulation or 'main_small_community_simulation.R' for the small community simulation.  However *the code requires the use of data from other places that are not included in this repository.  Therefore this code will not run as is.*  For details about data sources, see the associated publication (in submission), or contact the lead author directly at wgaul@hotmail.com.  

'community_size_and_list_lengths.RData' and 'spat_nrec_hec.RData' contain summaries of biological records from the Irish National Biodiversity Data Centre (http://www.biodiversityireland.ie/).  These data summaries are used to generate the simulation.  The original biological records data used to create these summaries is available from the Irish National Biodiversity Data Centre.
