# Data_quantity_is_more_important_than_its_spatial_bias_for_predictive_species_distribution_modelling
This repository contains code for the paper "Data quantity is more important than its spatial bias for predictive species distribution modelling" (Gaul W, Sadykova D, White HJ, Leon-Sanchez L, Caplat P, Emmerson MC, Yearsley JM. 2020. Data quantity is more important than its spatial bias for predictive species distribution modelling. PeerJ 8:e10411 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10411).

The simulations and analyses can be run by sourcing 'main_large_community_simulation.R' to run the large community simulation or 'main_small_community_simulation.R' for the small community simulation.  However *the code requires the use of data from other places that are not included in this repository.  Therefore this code will not run as is.*  For details about data sources, see the associated publication (Gaul et al. 2020, https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10411), or contact the lead author directly at wgaul@hotmail.com.  

'community_size_and_list_lengths.RData' and 'spat_nrec_hec.RData' contain summaries of biological records from the Irish National Biodiversity Data Centre (http://www.biodiversityireland.ie/).  These data summaries are used to generate the simulation.  The original biological records data used to create these summaries is available from the Irish National Biodiversity Data Centre.
